#' @param tau Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the quantile for
#'   identification in the Lewbel (2012) method. Default is 0.5 (median)
#'   following the literature. The choice of tau affects the identification
#'   strength and should be chosen based on the heteroskedasticity pattern
#'   in the data. Values closer to 0.5 typically provide more robust identification.
