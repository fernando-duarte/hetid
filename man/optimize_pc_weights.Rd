\arguments{
\item{pcs}{Matrix of principal components (n x J) where n is the number of
observations and J is the number of components, extracted from a broader set of
returns of financial assets.}

\item{w1}{Vector of reduced form residuals for Y1 (consumption growth)}

\item{w2}{Vector of reduced form residuals for Y2 (SDF innovations)}

\item{tau}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the quantile for
identification in the Lewbel (2012) method. Default is 0.5 (median)
following the literature. The choice of tau affects the identification
strength and should be chosen based on the heteroskedasticity pattern
in the data. Values closer to 0.5 typically provide more robust identification.}

\item{i}{Maturity index (for Y2 residuals)}

\item{use_t_minus_1}{Logical, if TRUE uses n-1 in variance/covariance denominators (unbiased),
if FALSE uses n (biased). Default is TRUE following standard econometric practice.}

\item{initial_weights}{Initial weights (default: equal weights)}

\item{method}{Optimization method (default: "Nelder-Mead")}

\item{maxit}{Maximum iterations (default: 1000)}

\item{penalty_complex}{Penalty for complex roots (default: 1e6)}

\item{dates}{Optional vector of dates corresponding to the time series}
}
\value{
List containing:
\item{optimal_weights}{Optimal normalized weights}
\item{roots}{The two roots at optimal weights}
\item{root_distance}{Distance between roots}
\item{objective_value}{Final objective function value}
\item{convergence}{Convergence indicator from optim}
\item{linear_comb}{The optimal linear combination (data frame if dates provided)}
\item{is_complex}{Whether roots are complex}
\item{dates_used}{If dates provided, the dates used after removing NA values}
}
\description{
Finds the optimal weights for a linear combination of principal components
that minimizes the distance between the two roots of the theta quadratic
equation, with preference for real roots.
