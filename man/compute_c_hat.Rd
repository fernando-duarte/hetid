\title{Compute Supremum Estimator (c_hat) for Term Structure Analysis}
\usage{
compute_c_hat(yields, term_premia, i)
}
\arguments{
\item{yields}{Numeric matrix of yield curve data from Adrian, Crump, and Moench (2013).
Rows represent time periods, columns represent maturities (1-10 years).
Missing values should be coded as NA. All values in annualized percentage points.}

\item{term_premia}{Numeric matrix of term premia data from Adrian, Crump, and Moench (2013).
Rows represent time periods, columns represent maturities (1-10 years).
Missing values should be coded as NA. All values in annualized percentage points.
By construction: Term Premium = Yield - Risk-Neutral Yield.}

\item{i}{Integer specifying the maturity index (column) to analyze.
Must be between 1 and ncol(yields). Corresponds to maturity in years
for ACM dataset (i=1 is 1-year, i=2 is 2-year, ..., i=10 is 10-year).
The maturity index determines which yield curve point is used in the analysis.}
}
\value{
Numeric value of c_hat_i
}
\description{
Computes c_hat_i which estimates sup_t exp(2*E_t[p_(t+i)^(1)]) following
the methodology in Adrian, Crump, and Moench (2013).
}
\details{
The supremum estimator provides an upper bound for the exponential of twice
the expected log price at horizon i.
}
\section{Data Source}{

The ACM data is sourced from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and is based on
the methodology described in Adrian, Crump, and Moench (2013). The data contains
model-implied yields, term premia, and risk-neutral yields for U.S. Treasury securities
with maturities from 1 to 10 years.
}

\section{Mathematical Formula}{

\deqn{c\_hat_i = \max_t \exp(2 \cdot n\_hat(i,t))}
}

\section{Literature Reference}{

This implements the supremum estimator from Adrian, Crump, and Moench (2013)
for term structure analysis.
