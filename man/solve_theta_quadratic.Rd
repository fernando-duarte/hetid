\title{Solve Quadratic Equation for Theta (Lewbel 2012 Method)}
\usage{
solve_theta_quadratic(pc_j, w1, w2, tau, use_t_minus_1 = TRUE, dates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pc_j}{Numeric vector, time series of PC_jt (principal component j extracted
from financial asset returns at time t)}

\item{w1}{Vector of reduced form residuals for Y1 (consumption growth)}

\item{w2}{Vector of reduced form residuals for Y2 (SDF innovations)}

\item{tau}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the quantile for
identification in the Lewbel (2012) method. Default is 0.5 (median)
following the literature. The choice of tau affects the identification
strength and should be chosen based on the heteroskedasticity pattern
in the data. Values closer to 0.5 typically provide more robust identification.}

\item{use_t_minus_1}{Logical, if TRUE uses n-1 in variance/covariance denominators (unbiased),
if FALSE uses n (biased). Default is TRUE following standard econometric practice.}

\item{dates}{Optional vector of dates corresponding to the time series. If provided, the function
will return information about which dates were used after removing NA values.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
\item{roots}{Numeric vector of length 2 containing the roots theta^(1) and theta^(2),
ordered so the root with smallest real part is first}
\item{coefficients}{Named vector with quadratic coefficients a, b, c where
a\emph{theta^2 + b}theta + c = 0}
\item{discriminant}{The discriminant b^2 - 4ac}
\item{components}{List containing all computed covariances and variances
used in the calculation}
\item{dates_used}{If dates parameter was provided, returns the dates corresponding to
observations used after removing NA values}
}
}
\description{
Finds the roots of the quadratic equation in theta given time series of PC_jt,
W_1,t+1, W_2,i,t+1, and a parameter tau using the identification through
heteroskedasticity approach from Lewbel (2012).
}
\details{
Note: W1 and W2 residuals are pre-computed using the appropriate timing
alignment, so the use_t_minus_1 parameter does NOT affect the PC timing.

Note: The input residuals W1 and W2 are expected to be pre-computed using the
appropriate timing alignment (typically using lagged PCs to predict future values).
The covariances and variances are computed using empirical estimators with either
n-1 or n in the denominator based on use_t_minus_1.

\section{Mathematical Formula}{

The function solves the quadratic equation:
\deqn{a \theta^2 + b \theta + c = 0}

where:
\deqn{a = (1 - \tau^2)}
\deqn{b = 2(\frac{Cov(W_1 W_2, W_2^2)}{Var(W_2^2)} \tau^2 -
  \frac{Cov(W_1 W_2, PC_j)}{Cov(W_2^2, PC_j)})}
\deqn{c = \frac{[Cov(W_1 W_2, PC_j)]^2}{[Cov(W_2^2, PC_j)]^2} -
  \frac{Var(W_1 W_2)}{Var(W_2^2)} \tau^2}
}

\section{Literature Reference}{

This implements the identification through heteroskedasticity approach from
Lewbel (2012), adapted for term structure analysis following the methodology
in Adrian, Crump, and Moench (2013).
