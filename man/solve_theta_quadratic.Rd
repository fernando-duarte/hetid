\usage{
solve_theta_quadratic(pc_j, w1, w2, tau, use_t_minus_1 = TRUE, dates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pc_j}{Numeric vector, time series of PC_jt (principal component j at time t)}

\item{w1}{Numeric vector, time series of W_1,t+1 (reduced form residual for Y1)}

\item{w2}{Numeric vector, time series of W_2,i,t+1 (reduced form residual for Y2 at maturity i)}

\item{tau}{Numeric, parameter between 0 and 1}

\item{use_t_minus_1}{Logical, if TRUE uses n-1 in variance/covariance denominators (unbiased),
if FALSE uses n (biased). Note: W1 and W2 residuals are pre-computed
using the appropriate timing alignment, so this parameter does NOT
affect the PC timing.}

\item{dates}{Optional vector of dates corresponding to the time series. If provided, the function
will return information about which dates were used after removing NA values.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
\item{roots}{Numeric vector of length 2 containing the roots theta^(1) and theta^(2),
ordered so the root with smallest real part is first}
\item{coefficients}{Named vector with quadratic coefficients a, b, c where
a\emph{theta^2 + b}theta + c = 0}
\item{discriminant}{The discriminant b^2 - 4ac}
\item{components}{List containing all computed covariances and variances
used in the calculation}
\item{dates_used}{If dates parameter was provided, returns the dates corresponding to
observations used after removing NA values}
}
}
\description{
Finds the roots of the quadratic equation in theta given time series of PC_jt,
W_1,t+1, W_2,i,t+1, and a parameter tau.
}
\details{
The function solves the quadratic equation:
a\emph{theta^2 + b}theta + c = 0

where:
\itemize{
\item a = (1 - tau^2)
\item b = 2*(Cov(W1\emph{W2, W2^2)/Var(W2^2) * tau^2 - Cov(W1}W2, PC_j)/Cov(W2^2, PC_j))
\item c = \[Cov(W1\emph{W2, PC_j)\]^2 / \[Cov(W2^2, PC_j)\]^2 - Var(W1}W2)/Var(W2^2) * tau^2
}

Note: The input residuals W1 and W2 are expected to be pre-computed using the
appropriate timing alignment (typically using lagged PCs to predict future values).
The covariances and variances are computed using empirical estimators with either
n-1 or n in the denominator based on use_t_minus_1.
