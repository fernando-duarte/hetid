\title{ACM Term Structure Data Documentation}
\format{
The ACM data is stored as a CSV file with the following structure:
\describe{
\item{date}{The business-day observation date for each row in the series
(originally 'DATE' in source data, standardized to lowercase)}
\item{ACMY01-ACMY10}{Model-implied zero-coupon Treasury yields from the ACM
model, for maturities of 1-year up to 10-years}
\item{ACMTP01-ACMTP10}{ACM term premium estimates for 1- to 10-year
maturitiesâ€”i.e., the additional compensation investors require for bearing
interest-rate risk}
\item{ACMRNY01-ACMRNY10}{Risk-neutral yields (the expected average short-rate
path) over 1- to 10-year horizons, as implied by the ACM model}
}
}
\description{
Documentation for the Adrian, Crump, and Moench (ACM) term structure dataset
available through the \code{load_term_premia()} and \code{extract_acm_data()}
functions. This dataset contains model-implied yields, term premia, and
risk-neutral yields for U.S. Treasury securities.
}
\details{
\subsection{Maturity Suffix}{

The numeric suffix 01-10 in each of the ACM fields denotes the maturity in
years (1 = one year, ..., 10 = ten years).
}

\subsection{Units}{

All yield, term-premium, and risk-neutral-yield values are expressed in
annualized percentage points (i.e., percent).
}

\subsection{Frequency}{

The dataset is monthly frequency (one entry per month), typically using
end-of-month observations.
}

\subsection{Relationship Between Fields}{

By construction, for each maturity n:
\deqn{\text{ACMTP}_n = \text{ACMY}_n - \text{ACMRNY}_n}

That is, the term premium is simply the difference between the model-implied
yield and the risk-neutral yield.

\section{Data Source}{

The data is sourced from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and is based on
the methodology described in Adrian, Crump, and Moench (2013).
}

\section{Usage}{

To access the raw ACM data:
\preformatted{
# Download the data (if not already available)
download_term_premia()

# Load the raw data
acm_raw <- load_term_premia()

# Or use the convenience function for processed data
acm_data <- extract_acm_data(
  data_types = c("yields", "term_premia"),
  maturities = c(2, 5, 10)
)
}
